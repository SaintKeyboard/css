        <h3>Sales</h3>
        <p>Outgoing, comes to mind in my sales approach, yes there is a element of being able to hook a customer and talk to them, but going the extra mile can be as little as coming round at a later time or helping with writing the forms out for
          them.
          I have learned a lot of skills like problem solving on the spot an training a team so they can also hit there own targets, but what I'm most proud off was learning the business acumen and book-keeping for myself.</p>
